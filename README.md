Pancake Translations

This repository contains a number of Pancake Translations, for those of us who don't use Pancake in English. These languages are built into Pancake and are updated with every release. We welcome all help, feedback and new languages.

If you need any help, [create an issue](https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/issues/new).

Do you have a translation for a new language?
---------------------------------------------

If you have a new translation you want us to store here, here's how to do it:

* If you know how to create a pull request, do that.
* If you don't know how to create a pull request, but know how to upload your translation, do that and [create an issue](https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/issues/new) with the URL where we can download your translation.
* If you don't know how to create a pull request and you don't know how to upload your translation, just email the language files to [bruno@pancakeapp.com](bruno@pancakeapp.com) and ask for them to be included here.

If any of this is not clear and you need any help, just [create an issue](https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/issues/new). We'll help you.

Do you want to improve a language that already exists?
------------------------------------------------------

If the language you're using already exists here, here's how to do it:

* If you know how to create a pull request, do that.
* If you don't know how to create a pull request, go to the language you want to edit (for example [https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/blob/master/german/pancake_lang.php](https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/blob/master/german/pancake_lang.php)), and click "Edit". Once you've made the changes you want, add a description of your changes and click "Commit changes". You'll then be allowed to create a pull request for the changes you've made. Do that, and we'll review your changes and approve them.

If any of this is not clear and you need any help, just [create an issue](https://github.com/pancakeapp/translations/issues/new). We'll help you.
